cheatsheet-generator
====================

A simple html generator that transforms a
an ini-like file (one that can be read with
`configobj <https://pypi.org/project/configobj/>`_)
into a HTML cheatsheet.


How to use
----------

Install Python (and configobj and jinja2)
and SASS and then
run the Makefile: all cheatsheets in the raw folder
will be built.
